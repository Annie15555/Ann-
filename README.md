ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, Iâ€™m Ann!
ðŸŒŸ Aspiring Data Analyst with a Creative Edge
Iâ€™m currently studying architecture but deeply passionate about data analytics â€” uncovering insights, telling stories with numbers, and turning raw data into meaningful actions.

ðŸŽ“ Curious Learner & Future Innovator
I love exploring how data shapes the world around us, from smart designs to better healthcare. My goal is to bridge my design background with analytical thinking to solve real-world problems.

ðŸŽ® Beyond Data
Outside my data deep-dives, I enjoy gaming, watching movies, and cherishing time with my family and loved ones.

ðŸš€ On a Mission to Grow
Iâ€™m here to learn, share, and collaborate. Letâ€™s connect and make sense of the world through data!
